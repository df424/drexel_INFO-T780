    "<li>jupyter</li>\n",
    "<li>tabulate</li>\n",

Likewise the IMDB rating as well as the metascore were given weights of 0.9 and 0.8 respectively since these features are considered important.  All other features were given a value between 0.1 and 0.3 as they are considered less important but should still have an impact.</p>\n",
    "<p>This section also sets up the local similarity functions.  Two different location functions are used one to compare the genres and the other to compare the ordinal data.  The genre comparison function returns a 1 if and only if the input vector has that genre selected and the movie vector is of that genre.  In otherwords it is essentally a logical AND gate.  Think of it as adding to the similarity if the input vector and the movie both have the genre listed, but no increase in similarity is added just because both the movie and the input vector both do not have a genre listed.</p>\n",
