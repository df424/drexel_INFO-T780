<h1>Assignment 3 - Machine Learning</h1>
<p>In this assignment we explore decisions trees and neural networks two fundemental machine learning  models.</p>
<p>The assignment is organized into three different notebooks to keep things neat.  Links to all three parts are given below.</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/df424/drexel_INFO-T780/blob/master/learning/decision_trees.ipynb">Decision Trees</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/df424/drexel_INFO-T780/blob/master/learning/keras_tut.ipynb">Keras Tutorial</a></li>
<li><a>Second Dataset</a></li>
</ol>
